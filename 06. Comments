// A comment is text you want Java to ignore. Comments allow you to describe code or keep notes.
// By using comments in the Java code, you may help yourself and even other programmers understand the purpose of code that a comment refers to.
// In Java, there are two styles of comments: single line comments and multi-line comments.

// Single line comments are one line comments that begin with two forward slashes:
// I'm a single line comment!

// Multi-line comments are generally longer comments that can span multiple lines. They begin with /* and end with */ . Here's an example:

/*

Hello, 
Java! 

*/




public class Comments {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		//System.out.println("Noise!");
    
    /*
    here is a multi-line comment
    */
		
	}
}
