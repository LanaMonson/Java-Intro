// Let's get familiar with how relational, equality, and Boolean operators can be used to control the flow of our code.

// 1). In Java, the keyword if is the first part of a conditional expression.
// 2). It is followed by a Boolean expression and then a block of code. 
// If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, the block of code that follows will be run.
// Here's an example of the if statement used with a conditional expression:

if (9 > 2) {
    System.out.println("Control flow rocks!");
}
// In the example above, 9 > 2 is the Boolean expression that gets checked. 
// Since the Boolean expression "9 is greater than 2" is true, Control flow rocks! will be printed to the console.

// The if statement is not followed by a semicolon (;). 
// Instead it uses curly braces ({ and }) to surround the code block that gets run when the Boolean expression is true.



public class If {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		if (8>6) {

			System.out.println("Access granted.");

		}
		
	}
}
