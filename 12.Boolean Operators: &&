//Boolean operator #1 - 'and'.

//The and operator is represented in Java by &&.
//It returns a boolean value of true only when the expressions on both sides of && are true.

// The following expression uses the "and" Boolean operator
System.out.println(true && true); 
// prints true

// The following expressions use the "and" Boolean operator
System.out.println(false && false); // prints false
System.out.println(false && true); // prints false
System.out.println(true && false); // prints false

//We can also use the Boolean operator && with Boolean expressions such as the following:
System.out.println(2 < 3 && 4 < 5);
//The example above will print out true because the statements "2 is less than 3" and "4 is less than 5" are both true.

//Challenge:

public class And {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println(true && false);
		
	}
}
//Output: false
